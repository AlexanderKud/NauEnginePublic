            A proxy object can be used for this. If a proxy is installed, all IServiceInitialization calls will be directed to it.
            If proxy exposes IServiceShutdown API then shutdownService() will also be called for proxy object
            (otherwise shutdownService() will be called for original object).

            IMPORTANT! To use the proxy mechanism, the source type must also expose IServiceInitialization/IServiceShutdown interfaces
            (this is required because service inter dependencies are computed for original types, not proxies, also other types knowns nothing about proxies.
            i.e. IServiceInitialization::getServiceDependencies() for proxy are ignored and never be called).
